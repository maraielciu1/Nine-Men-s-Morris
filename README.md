# Nine Men's Morris - Man vs. Computer Game

## Project Overview

This Python project is an implementation of the classic strategy board game **Nine Men's Morris**. The game allows a human player to compete against a computer opponent. The computer is designed to be "smart," calculating its moves based on a points-based system to make strategic decisions. The game follows the traditional rules of Nine Men's Morris, including placement, movement, and capturing phases.

## Features

- **Single-player Mode**: Human vs. Computer gameplay.
- **Smart AI**: The computer computes its next move using a points-based system that evaluates the board state and attempts to maximize its advantage.
- **Graphical Representation**: A visual representation of the game board.
- **Phases of the Game**:
  - **Placement Phase**: Players take turns placing their pieces on the board.
  - **Movement Phase**: Players move their pieces to adjacent points.
  - **Capturing Phase**: Once a player forms a mill (three pieces in a row), they can capture one of the opponent's pieces.
- **Points System for AI**: The computer uses a points system to evaluate possible moves and decide its next action, making the gameplay more challenging for the human player.
  
## Rules of the Game

Nine Men's Morris is a two-player strategy game where the objective is to reduce your opponent to two pieces or block all their moves. The game has three phases:
1. **Placement Phase**: Players alternate placing their nine pieces on empty spots on the board.
2. **Movement Phase**: Players move their pieces along lines to adjacent spots.
3. **Capturing Phase**: When a player forms a mill (three pieces in a row), they capture one of the opponent's pieces.

The game ends when one player is reduced to two pieces or is unable to make a valid move.
